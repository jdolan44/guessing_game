# Rust Guessing Game
This is my first project built using Rust. Through this project I hope to learn the basic workflow and syntax of Rust.  

This project follows from chapter 2 of the Rust Programming Language book, a.k.a. "The book".  

I also plan to add some extended features to test my own understanding of the language basics.
